            After filling out a short survey, we take those results and use a top-secret method to parse your future into human-readable text. We then take that text, read it, and follow it to the letter. 
            Have you ever considered that your life is being influenced and nudged along by invisible forces, unknown to everyone around you? 
            By using paid actors, we aim to guide your life through a roller coaster of emotions and a series of many ups and downs. 
            Our actors are masters of their craft, and we take great pride in how realistic and dedicated they are to their roles. 
            Let's give a hypothetical situation: You enter a gas station, and after gathering several unhealthy snacks, you head toward the counter. The cashier looks over with a judgmental gaze as they scan each item. 
            After you leave, this interaction sticks with you, and you instead choose to shop somewhere else for the foreseeable future. This is just one example of many ways our actors nudge you along your life's journey, 
            and ultimately to your intended destination.
